## File Overview

### ← README.md
The purpose of Counselor Suppor+ is guiding FGLI students and counselors from rural areas and students outside of the 50 states (territories and/or international FGLI students). We have the Documentation and Strategy sections to support students. We want to be their Suppor+ in the confusing application process.

### ← Documentation
We aim to help both counselors and students. In the documentation section we discuss what counselors need to know and what they are responsible for submitting. We explain school profiles, letters of recommendation, and transcripts. We have the for Students and counselor sections so both targets can benefit from more acurate information.


### Strategies area
Talk about website and what does and how you built it. 
This website aims to help low income students find answers on their college application journey. We discuss strategies/steps each grade (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) can take to make their college application process easier. To summarize, the website is an outline of what each grade can do. This website provides tips that aren't as shared or discussed. For example, cold emails, reaching out to alumni etc. We built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
